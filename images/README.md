## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG with transparent backgrounds preferred
- **Color**: Logos should work well on dark backgrounds
- **Quality**: High resolution for crisp display on all devices
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens

## Dark Theme Compatibility

All logos should be designed or adapted to work well with the dark cosmic theme:
- Light text/elements on transparent backgrounds
- Subtle glows or outlines for better visibility
- Avoid pure black elements that might disappear
- Consider adding subtle blue (#4fc3f7) accents to match the theme

## Implementation

The `index-site.html` file includes placeholder containers that will automatically show/hide based on image availability. When images are added to this directory, they will replace the placeholder boxes.
