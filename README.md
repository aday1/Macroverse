## 1. Energy Field (before the Big Bang and the beginning of time…)
and push it to your repository. This will trigger the deployment. 
> There was no matter. All that existed was space/time and energy. An ocean of energy,
> almost still but gently rippling. A near still ocean of energy filling the void.

## 2. Particles. (13.8 billion years ago…)

> Less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the energy transformed into tiny
> particles and radiation. These particles formed a very dense and hot ‘soup” of quarks,
> gluons, electronics, neutrinos and other particles – these are the tiniest known building
> blocks of everything in the universe.

## 3. Blue Giants (13.6 billion years ago…)

> Hydrogen and helium poured into the regions where the filaments crossed, gathering into
> ever-denser clouds. Gravity asserted its grip and the clouds of gas began to collapse,
> becoming denser and denser. In the densest regions the gas became so hot that nuclear
> fusion reactions began. Hundreds of times as massive as our sun, they shone with such
> ferocity that they shone blue. With surface temperatures in excess of 100,000 degrees, they
> were the largest stars ever to have lived.

## 4. Orbits. (11.2 billion years ago…)

> Over time these elements gathered together, creating rich clouds of gas and dust, nurseries
> where new generations of stars were born. And not just stars, but families of stars, the first
> galaxies. And around this time some of the earlier star systems formed in our own galaxy,
> the Milky Way. A new age of complexity was dawning in the universe. And crucially, new
> bodies had appeared, planets. Places where the rich chemical elements built by previous
> generations of stars could finally find a home.

## 5. Life As We Know It (3.5 billion years ago…)

> The universe abounds in complexity, from everyday systems such as turbulent streams and
> snowflakes to grand cosmic structures like nebulae and spiral galaxies. However, one class of
> complex systems – life – stands out as especially remarkable… Schrödinger identified life’s
> ability to buck the trend of the second law of thermodynamics as a defining quality. Living
> organisms achieve this entropy-defying feat by garnering and processing information and
> directing it into purposeful activity. By coupling patterns of information to patterns of
> chemical reactions… life conjures coherence and organisation from molecular chaos.

## 6. Living Our Best Life (now and beyond…)

> We are living in the age of stars, an era of light and life in the cosmos. From our fleeting
> human perspective, stars seem eternal.
